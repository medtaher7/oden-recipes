    What do you call eggs poached in a deliciously spicy tomato sauce? Many people would say ‘shakshuka’ but, the correct answer is actually ‘ojja’. Ojja is one of those staple dishes of Tunisia and many other surrounding counties. Over the years, however, people started using the name shakshuka to refer to both dishes. Shakshuka is similar in its base ingredients but usually has potatoes and doesn’t always have eggs, and is a recipe we look forward to sharing with you in the future. Ojja is the go to when in need of a quick yet flavorful food fix. It is often made with a spicy lamb sausage known as merguez, making for an amazing breakfast hearty enough to be eaten at any meal, but it can just as easily be made vegetarian. Tuna and sardines are also common additions and their punch of salt balances out the richness of the creamy egg. Need a way to spice up your boring morning eggs? Look no further than this recipe (below)!
