        Cooking The Couscous: 

Cooking the couscous depends on the couscous brand you purchased. Read the package instructions to know how much liquid is needed to steam the couscous. Then, add meat broth equal to the liquid measurement written on the package in a cooking pot and bring it to a boil. Then, turn the heat off and add the couscous. Stir the couscous and immediately cover the cooking pot. Allow the couscous to cook for 10 minutes without disturbing it. Then fluff the couscous using a fork to separate the granules.
